things that I should be doing.  

---

talking to everyone back home more  
sleeping  
everything in for-your-sanity  

---
---

things that I'm glad I do?  

---

running; running until you feel needling points of physical pain and a deafening drumming and you think you will not make it, but you do, and it's exhilarating and then exhausting, but in the best way possible  
remembering to carry an actual book every time you travel   
gardening  
cooking pretentiously  
deafening music that helps you code  
deafening classical music that is not meant to be listened to at deafening decibel levels  
typing notes up in LaTeX  

---
---

things that I want to stop doing?  

---

refusing to sleep all night, going through an entire next day sleep deprived
subconsciously ignoring messages   
spending too much time programming (?)  
spending too little time reading  
caring dangerously little about classes (you're not interested in)  
giving up things that i'm glad i do (read above, and yes, slightly circularly ironic) in lieu of _progress_ and _results_ that will make a _difference_ (or, in actuality, are most times really just fun and enlightening to see)  

---
---

things that (sigh) I'm forced to do..  

---

enforced regular calls to every distant relative in existence  
being compared to friends (sigh) who take new pictures, every day, of themselves, to send to their parents  
consistent questions of why I cannot be like that^
