"Brevity, or being succinct, is a skill that every writer should know is really important. Too many words should not be used." - Hemingway

---

what these were meant to be were few-word summaries -- picked-apart, illuminating phrases of the main takeaways of the book in question.  
  
but fewer words are hard to come by, and this may mean that I do not, by Hemingway's standards, know what every writer should know, but I think the ones below nicely put together the amount of information I would need to recollect and re-encounter what reading each of these books made me feel.

the ocean at the end of the lane by neil gaiman. magical, child-like and dark, with too-picturesque descriptions of strange artifacts (but also wonderfully comforting - is this just me and reminescense of childhood - descriptions of the house). this is equal parts fantasy and horror and innocence and immorality; and although I can see this being a YA or children's book; I would not, in good faith, recommend this to an eleven year old.
