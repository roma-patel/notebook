do humans defer to prototype models or exemplar models?

rosch and prototypes. prototypical models assume that humans, in their heads, conjure up a prototypical representation that forms the basis of their understanding of a particular category or concept. to make a decision about a new instance belonging to the category, they compare it to this prototypical representation and judge similarity to it. in exemplar models, rather than abstracting away the prototype, we store in our heads every example - that is, _exemplar_ - of an instance that we've seen, and to make a decision on a new instance, we compare it to every existing exemplar, use a heuristic e.g., sum of similarities and make a categorical decision on that basis. 

there exist two general principles for the formation of categories; first that the task of category systems is to provide maximum information with the least cognitive effort and second, that the perceived world comes as structured information rather than arbitrary and unpredictable attributes. the first therefore deals with the function of category systems while the second has todo with the structure of information provided within. combining the two, maximum information with minimal cognitive effort is achieved if categories formed map the perceived world structure as closely as possible.
