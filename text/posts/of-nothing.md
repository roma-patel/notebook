    Remember, remember! 
    The fifth of November, 
    The Gunpowder treason and plot; 
    I know of no reason 
    Why the Gunpowder treason 
    Should ever be forgot!

semantic networks are a different approach to having formal meaning representations i.e., instead of semantic parsing, but it's a very similar setup in the sense that you have entities or concepts that are related by functions or verbs to other concepts. e.g., child. what I want to do, is to use these semantic networksby constraining the amount of information that you get and what we want is to see how this affects the ability to reason pragmatically or even co-ordinate with one another.

think more about setting it up and also graph flow theory..

    Threescore barrels, laid below, 
    To prove old England's overthrow. 
    But, by God's providence, him they catch, 
    With a dark lantern, lighting a match! 
    A stick and a stake 
    For King James's sake! 
    If you won't give me one, 
    I'll take two, 
    The better for me, 
    And the worse for you. 
    A rope, a rope, to hang the Pope, 
    A penn'orth of cheese to choke him, 
    A pint of beer to wash it down, 
    And a jolly good fire to burn him.

that there are two agents with some sort of informational asymmetry basd on the information that they have i.e., we can't function with only oe of the agents; and our goal is to reason pragmatically about the inputand map it to some output. and obviously a fundamental aspect of this isthe knowledge that each agent has; so how their vocabulary is constrained and the probabilities of referring to objects.
