    Remember, remember! 
    The fifth of November, 
    The Gunpowder treason and plot; 
    I know of no reason 
    Why the Gunpowder treason 
    Should ever be forgot!

semantic networks are a different approach to having formal meaning representations i.e., instead of semantic parsing, but it's a very similar setup in the sense that you have entities or concepts that are related by functions or verbs to other concepts. e.g., child. what I want to do, is to use these semantic networksby constraining the amount of information that you get and what we want is to see how this affects the ability to reason pragmatically or even co-ordinate with one another.

think more about setting it up and also graph flow theory..

that there are two agents with some sort of informational asymmetry basd on the information that they have i.e., we can't function with only oe of the agents; and our goal is to reason pragmatically about the inputand map it to some output. and obviously a fundamental aspect of this isthe knowledge that each agent has; so how their vocabulary is constrained and the probabilities of referring to objects.

Gaiman?

    If I were young as once I was,  
    and dreams and death more distant then,  
    I wouldn't split my soul in two,  
    and keep half in the world of men,  
    So half of me would stay at home,  
    and strive for Faërie in vain,  
    While all the while my soul would stroll  
    up narrow path, down crooked lane,  
    And there would meet a fairy lass  
    and smile and bow with kisses three,  
    She'd pluck wild eagles from the air  
    and nail me to a lightning tree  
    And if my heart would run from her  
    or flee from her, be gone from her,  
    She’d wrap it in a nest of stars  
    and then she'd take it on with her  
    Until one day she'd tire of it,  
    all bored with it and done with it.  
    She'd leave it by a burning brook,  
    and off brown boys would run with it.  
    They'd take it and have fun with it  
    and stretch it long and cruel and thin,  
    They'd slice it into four and then  
    they'd string with it a violin.  
    And every day and every night  
    they'd play upon my heart a song  
    So plaintive and so wild and strange  
    that all who heard it danced along  
    And sang and whirled and sank and trod  
    and skipped and slipped and reeled and rolled  
    Until, with eyes as bright as coals,  
    they'd crumble into wheels of gold  . . . .  
      
      
    But I am young no longer now,  
    for sixty years my heart's been gone  
    To play its dreadful music there,  
    beyond the valley of the sun.  
    I watch with envious eyes and mind,  
    the single–souled, who dare not feel  
    The wind that blows beyond the moon,  
    who do not hear the Fairy Reel.  
    If you don't hear the Fairy Reel,  
    they will not pause to steal your breath.  
    When I was young I was a fool.  
    So wrap me up in dreams and death.
