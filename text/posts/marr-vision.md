stray thoughts from Newton, Helmholtz, Wertheimer and illustrious others: notice that the apparent motion, not of individual dots, but of wholes, or "fields" in images, is presented sequentially as in a movie. in much the same way that we perceive migration across the sky, flowing of waves and gusts of wind, _solidarity_ and _distinctness_ of parts and subparts come into play, and the above tried to formulate laws that governed the creation of these "wholes". this was not thoroughly proved, however there have been certain findings by Barlow (1972): each single neuron can perform a much more complex and subtle task than had previously been thought i.e., they do not loosely remap luminous intensities of a visual image onto our sensorium, but instead detect pattern elements, discriminate depths, textures, surfaces, ignore irrelevant causes of variation and are arranged in an intriguing hierarchy. activities of neurons are quite simply _thought processes_ and thinking is brought about by neurons i.e., each neuron might play a significant role in perception.

the hardest part is that humans are terribly good at vision; the notions of feature detectors and all attempts to extract useful information did not perform anywhere near as well as a human visual system. the elusive problem: edges are critically important and often cannot be found by looking at intensity changes.

interestingly Waltz (1975) and Mackworth (1973) essentially solved the interpretation problem for line drawings i.e., they showed that an exhaustive analysis of local physical arrangements of surfaces, edges and shadows could be combined with an effective algorithm for interpreting an actual image. 

note that this is similar to simulated environments and toy worlds we use now; once a world of white blocks or coloured blocks is "solved", we have the basis for attacking more complex problems and richer environments. but does this always hold?

Land and McCann (1971) on the retinex theory of colour vision. 

Elizabeth Warrington's work suggests two things: first, the representation of the shape of an object is different from the representation of its use and purpose. second, vision alone can deliver an internal description of the shape of a viewed object (even when the object in question is not recognised in the conventional sense of it's most probable use and purpose). Similarly, Tenenbaum and Barrow (1976) show that prior knowledge about objects help recognition even in the absence of entirely distinct visual information. 

the primary job of vision is to derive a representation of shape, although this is by no means all that vision can and should do (read: illumination, reflectances of surfaces, visual textures, spatial arrangement).

interestingly, this hints at primal sketches being important in that they make explicit, information about the two dimensional image and intensity changes. primitives are zero crossings, terminations and discontinuities, edge segments, virtual lines etc.

however the derivation of shape information should require all three representational stages (how is this determined?), namely image, primal sketch, 2(1/2)-D sketch and 3D model representation i.e., a modular hierarchical representation.
