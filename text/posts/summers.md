“And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.” - Fitzgerald, _The Great Gatsby_

still ongoing, but let's begin with what is done; san francisco and so much sunshine! there are few cities where you will find Uber drivers exactly your age that study cognitive science at Berkeley, both greek and victorian architecture and presidio style forts amidst quaint coffee shops and glassy corporate buildings. there is the ever present gray ocean mist and gold sunshine and good conversation wherever you will go.

fake AI conference but glorious embarcadero views. this unexpectedly may have been the least exciting part of the trip. but then again, this says more about aforementioned encounters, the brilliance and the people at the university visits than anything perceptible about the place itself.

berkeley, running up stairs, but finally arrive in a disheveled office - because of plans to move to another coast - but it is absolutely, indisputably worth being able to talk about strange psychological work and what I want to work on and what he is already working on; and even when functioning on ~2 hours worth of sleep, this is all very inspiring. 

walking out in the blinding sunshine along creeks and woods (are these woods? I thought Princeton was alone in its deer-ridden and woodland-esque campus) and the tall clock tower on campus, still speaking of rationality bounds and human cognition and then it's time for another meeting. aside: it's slightly dispiriting that inspiration, this spark of enlightenment does not work both ways? i highly doubt that he is _inspired_ by his work at every talk, lecture and recounting of it? it's almost dispiriting, because it's a wonderful feeling.

the next meeting is nice (i'm always astounded at people taking the time to listen to almost nonsensical ramblings of stray undergrads). temporal flow of events, plot and story-lines. once i'm fully done, have made progress enough in deciphering (?) human reasoning, grounding, this is something that I want to look into.

then high-school friends and walking around; this is a campus quite like no other, a strange, eclectic mixture of wooden bridges and greek amphitheatres, almost run-down buildings but a tangible sense of brilliance around you and always the sparkling sunshine and smell of the sea.

sitting in a study room, recounting high-school events, walking to a coffee shop and finally leaving to meet more high-school friends in more campuses across the city. reaching around 2am, exhausted, but content.

stanford is almost defined by red brick and open spaces; bicycles rush past you and people walk by with their faces buried in old textbooks. everyone is nicer than they should be and they all make time to speak to me and bestow their wisdom. i'm similarly inspired, but slightly more exhausted. both office-meetings were _brilliant_, forgive the overuse of the word; there is so much you can tell from the books on shelves, the height of a desk, the number of monitors and all else that there is to see. both have brilliant insights and my ideas (that I thought weren't actually ideas) seem to be things that they work on as well? it's possible and probable that this is mostly kindness and good advising, but i'm encouraged and excited and want to find a place to do work, even though the sleep deprivation is now quite alarming.

i was probably the only person in the world who didn't want to go here (in retrospect, i'm glad i never visited) but i can see it now; the brilliance, the open space and endless corridors and the friends i've made who will be here. 

i'm put off by the architecture (where is the old gray stone, the ivy and the grandeur of pretentious east coast schools?) but the warmth and the sunshine almost makes up for it. 

the airport is exhausting and flights are delayed and all i want to do is to please, _please_ sleep, but i'm finally home and can mostly recap all the conversations. doing reimbursements at the end makes me realise the distance I've covered this year.

new york for the JSALT planning meeting. meeting sam, ian, alex (who I now see probably every day (every hour?) this summer) for the first time. 

another advising meeting with ellie at google. everything is rushed, but we continue our discussion - at the office, in the lift, walking on the street and in between conference room meetings. there is always so much to say and update on and think about with coordination and RSA and vision, grounding, prototypes, exemplars. 

google funded happy hour at an (underground?) bar. dipanjan's stories inevitably involve pizza and his sons and are somehow always entertaining.

two entire days of NYU conference rooms, fixing down workflows, subteams, model architectures and objectives. breaking for dinner and drinks and reconvening the next day.

everything is meticulously planned and articulated and noted down. we all leave, excited (and nervous?) about an intensive 6 weeks of work together this summer.

walking back to Penn station, meeting tom who is on the same train, but forgot, but by a happy coincidence, managed to still make it. we talk for hours(s?) on the train, until one of the stops arrive, and then i'm home.

new orleans for naacl.

JSALT!

Saarbrucken, Germany and wonderful people, none of whom I will see again?

home (?), providence, rhode island

todo: multiple new york trips, broadway, NAACL in new orleans, jazz and dizzying streets, leaving philadelphia, arriving in baltimore, another new york trip and ongoing? the house of Edgar Allan Poe, barbequeing (Alexis, Shuning and baking with bluberries and brownies. trying to plate everything perfectly; we start at Sam's at 6 and assess what we have; too many bags of chips lying on every flat surface, Sam makes lebaneh, we have endless dips, bacon-wrapped dates, salads, nuts, bread grilled to perfection and beer and wine; we move to the 5th floor barbeque; Ellie and I grilling endless skewers of meat and shrimp, marvelling at the blistering heat of the grill, Ian disappears for an hour to return with brussel sprouts, sitting and eating and drinking with the team on the patio, then going back to Sam's for dessert and wine)

2017.

hour-long research meetings, both alone and with the group. being able to use the grid and no longer limited by what a laptop can handle; exploring the strangest datasets, there are so many that are unused and will remain unused that i'm almost frustrated.

taking a break to go to canada (why is everything and everyone so much nicer here?). living in what is literally a mansion, meeting the most incredible people and eating the most wonderful food. 

the absence, or diminished importance at least, of Starbucks is refreshing and everyone drinks the exact same kind of coffee. niagara on a rainy day and we are freezing but undeterred and walk along the falls and everything is beautiful and cold and so different from what I am used to. 

the arcade strip is dizzying; we are exhausted but buy a bucket of coins and try out every machine and it's been years (?) since any of us did this, but it's nostalgic and child-like and we're all, i think, happy. the skywheel halts at the top for an indeterminably long time and it's quiet and dark and glittering all over; there are strange dinosaur statues that we didn't notice and we're laughing for some reason and slightly dizzy. 

walking back along the strip and eating street food that tastes so much better than philadelphia street food. each person leaves one by one somewhere along the way back home.

back at Penn, sometimes sleeping at 3 and still waking up at 5 and going to the lab because it will be silent and dark and I will make _progress_ even through the sleep deprivation. 

walking over the bridge at night, tired but happy. 

sometimes frantically running scripts a day before presentations and sometimes managing to glean insight. 

wharton meetings about the strangest projects and clunch meetings with talks and disucssions; i'm continually inspired by most people there (mm, dr who are old and wise and still willing to talk and advise us undergrads, jh, sm who are really mostly my age but academically so much more advanced)

acl in vancouver; being an undergrad in the midst of intimidating but always inspiring people who are actually nice (!!) and want to know what I work on (!!!). running from one room to another to sit in on talks that i've marked in the handbook, wanting to ask questions but always backing out (i'll read the paper again, i'm sure i can answer it myself, what if i misunderstood, what if it's not really relevant). getting lunch with new people every day and exploring vancouver. conferences are exhausting but i think i will grow to love this.

the end of the summer when things feel strange; vn coming to stay and suddenly everything is so much better. three (?) days of laughter and walking around the city and actually being together before the three days are over and it's phone calls and messages and never enough effort put into anything.

the last few days and soon it will be less research and more coursework, but I have learnt far more this summer than i ever have before and i can't imagine liking anything more than NLP research.

there is something magical about Princeton; this is where it all _began_, this is where you can still see marks of brilliance and statues in dedication and writings on stone walls and you can try, and fail, to be uninspired by it all. 

in retrospect, the area and the town are mostly unexciting, but there is a quiet charm about the grand and carefully architectured buildings, the open fountain we sit by in the summer, the eating clubs and the libraries. 

the steep slopes that make for painful biking and the hidden gardens we explore in the evenings. the invited talks, the research meetings, the abstract math and proofs we try to put together. 

my ever-changing roomates are from Turkey, from Spain and various parts of this country and we are a strange and wonderful mix of people who come from different worlds but get along wonderfully. 

the house is quiet and you can hear every sound; the _town_ is quiet and you can feel every sound, every shift in the weather, the thunderstorms and blisteringly hot days.

barbecue parties and meeting Princeton grad students. they are remarkably down-to-earth, there is no air of pretentiousness and self-acclaimed brilliance. 

a summer of approximation algorithms and convoluted proofs. 

solving intensely hard problem sets in our group, mentoring the beginner group as they learn to write their first proofs. marveling at how easy that was.

giving a lecture for the first time ever. explaining the max flow min cut algorithm, trying to clear any doubts they could possibly have.

midnight trips to the study room to use the whiteboard to write proofs. 

midnight advising meetings.

playing werewolves and card games with the edelmans.

cooking dinner with harsh and ansh.

being forced to chop vegetables with harsh and ansh and (?). walking back after through the woods and the stadium.

eating lunch with invited speakers and hearing them talk about the strangest things. walking to nassau as a group; everyone unanimously chooses bent spoon every time.

getting bent spoon icecream far too often.

getting smallworld coffee far too often.

cycling tirelessly up slopes and then it is worth it when you can speed down and rush through the woods and find unexplored paths to bike and walk through.

cycling through the woods and seing the collider for the first time. stopping to stare; to take it all in.

exploring untraversed parts of the campus and walking over the bridge. watching the row-boats, watching people furiously practice to triumph over the other Ivys.

reading in the library, always sad when my favourite armchair is occupied.

the Princeton art museum, the open fountain, the math library on the way home.

the outdoor garden-seating across the house. the garden near the lake at lakeside.

picking blueberries at wildwood (i never got the name down correctly) farms, drinking wine that is sweet, but perfect for that day, walking along the fields and sitting in the wooden restaurant and forgetting to take pictures, but we did get souveniers.

walking through the woods and we see deer that stop to let us pass.

rescuing a squirrel that then injures (?) sam.

trying and failing to go to new york. vn staying for a while, walking through gardens and stone buildings. drinking expensive wine and eating at places i've still not explored. awkward introductions to roommates. i felt absolutely fine, happy even, before the visit. but maybe it is because my roommates are leaving as well (six months in India? visiting Turkey?) and it is empty and sad.

soon everyone is gone and i'm left here for another two weeks. biking around alone, exploring the library and Nassau and the woods. visiting cousins I didn't know I had and working on stray problems that come my way and starting the programming stuff, it's always fascinating to visualise the assignments. spending time in the quiet outdoors and endless woods. i'm excited to be in a more exciting place, but i think i will miss the silence and the unnoticed excellence of everyone who is here.

2015

this is possibly the last summer that i will be in bombay and i want to take it all in, have a token of remembrance for the sake of posterity, but there are exams and parties and sleepovers and it's suddenly all over.

i won't miss the noise; the smoke in the air and children on the street that you want to help, but can't. but i will miss the colour, the streets at night, the dizzying array of stalls along causeway and linking round, the furious rain, and most of allthe people. i don't know if i will ever like anyone as much as i like the people i knew here, and i also don't know if i will be (or can be?) a part of it anymore. we will always be friends; always know what is happening in our lives, but our conversations will be through messages and phone calls and always transient and fleeting and never really fulfilling. but i have no real regrets, and the years of happiness and warm weather and laughter have been worth it.

a ten-day long trip to a place i have never been to with people i have never spoken to. i was _furious_ that my usual friend group cancelled, but i made so many new friends and it was more than i could ever have asked for; i cannot remember ever laughing more than we did in these ten days. 

we are in north india where people speak the same language, eat the same food and look exactly like us but it's remarkable how different everything is. 

exploring places and sneaking out every night. 

dancing to horrifically terrible music the first night and laughing as each song gets worse.

eating dubious food from stalls on streets that tasted wonderful; walking through rivers and over hills and sitting in buses that wildly veer along mountain roads, always driven too near the edge. 

listening to music that everyone knows, so everyone can sing along. 

laughing hysterically at the stupidest things. laughing hysterically at dd's hysterical laugh. 

eating local (and questionable) chocolate and chips. 

singing at the top of our voices, messing up words and laughter insterspered with music. 

sitting around campfires (was this on this trip?). 

jallianwala bagh and reading about the massacre. there are bullets embedded in the walls and rifles all arond. the writings on stone and on the walls are poignant and graphic, but still beautiful amidst the terribleness. i don't know about everyone there, but i'm struck by the retelling of the events by the tour guide and the rest of the day is strange.

four of us walking to the parade, arms intertwined, always laughing. we make up a song and videotape synchronised footsteps. we're seperated from the group somehow, but we find them at the parade and walk back together.

the final train ride is filled with the usual laughter, but we're all sad that this is ending, and we will go back to classes and split into our friend groups, but we make promises of keeping in touch and talking more. the train compartment is small and smelly, but we all cram in to make room for everyone. someone (who was this?) wants to try and get out at every single station, just for the sake of it. there's unfinished alcohol in plastic bottles to hide from the teachers and far too much junk food that we try to finish and then feel ill, but happy, and always glad that this entire trip happened.

another ten-day long trip (i really think these should be made compulsory, everyone must experience the strangeness and wonderfulness and happiness of it all) and this time i know everyone i will be living with.

jim corbett national park; i never saw a tiger, only endless tracks that mark its presence, but the place is wonderful.  

looking out over the valley from the top of the mountain.

singing along the trails with Aish, walking along mountain paths.

early morning wildlife tour trip.

walking to the deserted lawn, being followed by strange people.

stories of leopards and tigers around the camp area. 

rafting in ice cold water. Arjun falling off the raft, we laugh hysterically then all jump off in succession.

2013

the summer camp with Shaina, Aviva and hundreds of unknown faces.

campfire nights, sitting in a circle and singing, dancing near the flames.

staring into the fire as shapes begin to form.

samy says i'm beautiful; the strangeness of the word, how it wasn't something that I had ever thought of until then

kayaking in the river, swimming in the lake

bouldering and the training warpath

sitting on the grass at night, laughing hysterically and circling the key

aviva falling, breaking her leg


---

from school?

dancing on the bed and singing with makeshift hairspray mics.

week long sleepovers and drives to weekend getaways with Tvish.

long walks on carter road.

endless trips to the strip for ice cream.

driving to amby alley, driving to mahbaleshwar, a house full of people i've never met.

playing cricket on the lawn outside the house in amby valley.

go karting with Tvish and Ty.
