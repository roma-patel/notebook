warm orange chocolate cake

.

this one needs to be perfected, deeper orange notes as opposed to the sour tangy flavour that exists now?  

bittersweet chocolate, semisweet chocolate (preferably valrhona?)
one whole orange (or a bottle of orange flavouring as needed)
finely ground cardamom
3 sticks of unsalted butter, sugar, salt, cream
2 eggs, tablespoon of flour


heat the chocolate and butter in a saucepan and stir in cream  
squeeze orange juice into a glass and stir in brown sugar and cardamom  
once melted, add in nearly all of the orange mixture  
whisk eggs, sugar and salt together until smooth  
quickly fold chocolate into the egg mixture along with the flour  
spoon the batter into ramekins and bake until the sides are firm (not for too long, this is important!)  
carefully turn over and serve
