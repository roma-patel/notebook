“In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.”

winters in bombay are not quite distinguishable from every-day weather; there is only a lingering sense of the bleakness and barrenness that would normally pervade places that know an actual winter. there is, of course, the absence of the sweltering summer heat, the inescapable muggy October weather and the smell of rain and earth in the monsoons. there is also the onslaught of inescapable festivites; firecrackers and rangolis (diwali) and prayers at temples, bells and carols (christmas) and visits to churches, the carnivals in December, the fire temples in parsi colony, navratri dances, kite flying festivites and so many more that I will again never be a part of.
