things to worry about:

---

forward functions:
literal pragmatic
rsa pragmatic
ranking loss
cosine embedding loss

---

encoders:

sent: JSALT encoder (bilstm, linear, max pool) -> then linear for image 
sent: bilstm, rnn, bow --> image
images: CNN encoder
different forward functions

---

loss:

cosine
bce
l1 (no!)
margin

---

things:

tune margin!
tune temperature, distractor_size

---

less important things:

JSALT hyperparams?
validate for glue?
CNN encoder?
datasets
