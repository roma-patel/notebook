how is behavior shaped by the iterated learning process? experiments involve 1. computational aspect: agent-based simulations and mathematical modeling and 2. non computational: laboratory experiments in humans and animals. 

iterated learning is the process by which behavior arises in one individual through induction i.e., on the basis of observations and behavioral stimulus in another individual who acquired the behavior in the same way. 

foundational work by Hurford set off the agent-interaction, computational simulation aspect of modeling emergence of language. the role of interaction and negotiation and learner bias is important to produce communicatively optimal systems. efforts have also been directed towards explaining how linguistic structure can arise from iterative interaction. 

there is a wide range of agent based models that suggest that key design features of language emerge from iterated learning. the different efforts also differ in their approaches (apart from being intrinsically reliant on iterative interaction) i.e., exemplar models, grounded robotic models, vision-related models, connectionist models and using symbolic grammars. but all of these rely on the same base concept.


mathematical models: pioneering work showed that the success of a language depends on how many people understand the language; children can end up speaking different languages from  learners/people they observe and this framework can be used to answer questions.  how constrained does language learning need to be to ensure that agents interacting will end up speaking the same language? and how do the limitations bound rational agents?
