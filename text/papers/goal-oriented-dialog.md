goal: want a testbed for dialog systems i.e., not something that relies on slot-filling and not neural models that are not goal-oriented (i.e., random generation of social-media language). also shows an end-to-end dialog system based on memory networks.

past work: slot filling is not domain adaptable and end to end dialog systems are adaptable but not goal-oriented. goal-oriented dialog requires skills that go beyond language modeling i.e., asking clear (pragmatic) questions, querying knowledge bases, interpreting results from queries, completing transactions etc.

they aim to break down the broad goal-oriented objective into smaller subtasks to test each one in order to understand performance and proper evaluation of a system. they work in the restaurant reservation domain and design a set of 5 tasks that are grounded with an underlying KB of restaurants and properties. these tasks cover issuing API calls, updating UPI calls, displaying options, providing extra information and conducting full dialogs; where the last is a combination of the previous tasks to generate full dialog. 

also goes over an evaluation of several old-school systems and learning methods i.e., rule-based systems, tf-idf and nearest-neighbor metrics for IR, using embedding representations and finally memory networks.
