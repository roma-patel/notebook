imagine a function that encapsulates all the weights in an intricate neural connections in the human brain; this corresponds to all prior knowledge, experiences and outcomes and these are what map one representation state to another. but there can exist variants of representation states -- think of this as a result of an agent being placed in different environments, where their reactions and future thoughts differ even when starting from the same function.

the key abstraction is that we, as humans, reasoning about a particular concept,  are not explicity aware of all possible neurons, but only a subset of them that correspond to what we are thinking about at that point in time. so consciousness is a projection of _some_ of the elements in the representation state.
