do children form production rules only when it is more computationally efficient to do so?
---

learning how to generalise a pattern and restrict it (in uncalled-for scenarios) is something tht children manage to do efficiently. the _tolerance principle_, an attempt to quantify these conditions and situations of generalisation, hyothesis that a general rule to be followed is frmed when it is computationally more efficient that storing lexical forms individually. 

there exist, as always, idiosyncratic exceptions that must be memorised; but even then, it has long since been debated how regular and irregular rules are handled by children. the tolerance principle is a learning model that quantifies the precise conditions for generalisation during language acquisition. the hypothesis is this: a general rule is formed when storing individual lexical forms that fit the rule is individually is computationally intensive (computing computational efficiency based on time complexity of rule application versus accessing individual lexical forms). there is a theoretical tipping point at which forming a productive rule becomes less computationally efficient than an alternative strategy and the tolerance principle allows us to compute this tipping point.
