tversky and kahneman on the anchoring and adjustment heuristic: in many situations people make estimations based on an initial prior i.e., a starting point that may be suggested by the formulation of a problem, some partial computation or some inherent bias of the speaker. this is then iteratively adjusted by an algorithm, however, adjustments are typically insufficient. different starting points yield differente estimates, which are biased toward the initial values.
