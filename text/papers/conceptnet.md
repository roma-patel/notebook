concept net (1072_paper and 1073)

at a high level, earlier concept net versions collected facts and common sense knowledge, but concept net 5 collects sources of such facts and knowledge, representing them in a graph to allow traversal in a way that makes use of relations between concepts to further natural language understanding.

this is kind of cool, given that you traverse weighted links and can stop at each and mine information from the web (e.g., multiple urls) and traverse url links as well. 

elements: 
concepts i.e., words and phrases from natural language 
assertions i.e., the way that these concepts relate to each other
justifications i.e., sources or links to validate (or gain more information) about the associated assertions and concepts.

so especially for legal ambiguity, a child links to all other concepts and uses of the word child.
